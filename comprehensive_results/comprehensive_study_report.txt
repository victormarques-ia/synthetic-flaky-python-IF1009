Study Duration: 6.8 minutes
Framework: Synthetic Flaky Python

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This study analyzed 5 types of flakiness and 4 mitigation strategies.
Best overall strategy: ISOLATION (ROI: 51.68)
Total experiments executed: 375

FLAKINESS CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
RANDOMNESS:
  • Pass Rate: 40.2% (flakiness index: 0.496)
  • Severity: High
  • Predictability: Moderately Predictable
  • Mechanism: Non-deterministic assertions based on random values

TIMEOUT:
  • Pass Rate: 66.4% (flakiness index: 0.266)
  • Severity: Moderate
  • Predictability: Moderately Predictable
  • Mechanism: Time-dependent assertions failing under load or slow systems

ORDER:
  • Pass Rate: 11.1% (flakiness index: 0.000)
  • Severity: Low
  • Predictability: Highly Predictable
  • Mechanism: Shared state between tests causing order dependencies

EXTERNAL:
  • Pass Rate: 77.3% (flakiness index: 0.324)
  • Severity: High
  • Predictability: Low Predictability
  • Mechanism: Network failures, service unavailability, or slow responses

RACE:
  • Pass Rate: 72.4% (flakiness index: 0.192)
  • Severity: Moderate
  • Predictability: Moderately Predictable
  • Mechanism: Thread synchronization issues and timing-dependent failures

MITIGATION STRATEGY EFFECTIVENESS
----------------------------------------
RETRIES:
  • Pass Rate Improvement: +1.5%
  • Performance Overhead: -7.7%
  • Effectiveness Score: 0.034

MOCKING:
  • Pass Rate Improvement: +26.7%
  • Performance Overhead: -67.3%
  • Effectiveness Score: 0.388

ISOLATION:
  • Pass Rate Improvement: +30.5%
  • Performance Overhead: -12.1%
  • Effectiveness Score: 0.250

COMBINED:
  • Pass Rate Improvement: +58.9%
  • Performance Overhead: -43.1%
  • Effectiveness Score: 0.542

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
RETRIES:
  • ROI: 5.93
  • Recommendation: Consider for cost-sensitive environments

MOCKING:
  • ROI: 41.50
  • Recommendation: Recommended - good balance of cost and benefit

ISOLATION:
  • ROI: 51.68
  • Recommendation: Consider for cost-sensitive environments

COMBINED:
  • ROI: 45.41
  • Recommendation: Highly recommended - excellent ROI and effectiveness

PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
Implementation Priority Ranking:
  1. ISOLATION (ROI: 51.68)
  2. COMBINED (ROI: 45.41)
  3. MOCKING (ROI: 41.50)
  4. RETRIES (ROI: 5.93)

Recommendations by Flakiness Type:
  • Randomness: Use MOCKING
    Expected effectiveness: 90.0%
    Notes: Mock random number generators with fixed values
  • Timeout: Use ISOLATION
    Expected effectiveness: 80.0%
    Notes: Run tests in isolated processes to reduce resource contention
  • Order: Use ISOLATION
    Expected effectiveness: 90.0%
    Notes: Essential for preventing state sharing between tests
  • External: Use MOCKING
    Expected effectiveness: 95.0%
    Notes: Mock all external API calls and services
  • Race: Use ISOLATION
    Expected effectiveness: 90.0%
    Notes: Run tests in separate processes to eliminate race conditions

General Guidelines:
  • Start with retries for quick wins with minimal investment
  • Identify root causes of flakiness before choosing mitigation strategy
  • Mock external dependencies in CI/CD pipelines
  • Use test isolation for tests with shared state
  • Monitor test stability metrics continuously
  • Invest in fixing root causes rather than just mitigating symptoms
